# Manoj Speaks

**Manoj Speaks**, a podcast channel of Manoj Kumar (owner of this Github page) was launched in April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, born out of a desire to connect and share meaningful conversations while locked down at home. On this podcast, Manoj Kumar engages with people from diverse backgrounds, diving deep into their lives, careers, and perspectives. Each episode offers insights into topics that span across life and work, hobbies, entrepreneurship, business, relationships, and current events—no topic is off-limits. When no guest is available, Manoj isn’t afraid to go solo, offering personal reflections and insights that keep the conversation engaging and thought-provoking.

The podcast is hosted on **Spotify** and is available on major platforms including **Apple Podcasts, Radio Public, Overcast, and Pocket Casts**. For the channel cover art, Manoj used Procreate to create his own outline, giving it a personal touch, and finalized the artwork on Canva, capturing the essence of the podcast’s open, inviting approach to exploring the human experience.

### Technical Details for the Website

The website for **Manoj Speaks** was built using **React**, designed to be a static, one-page layout that highlights essential information about the podcast. Key elements include a prominent show cover image, podcast description, and easy-access icons linking to various platforms where the podcast can be heard. The layout is fully responsive, transitioning seamlessly between desktop and mobile views. Flexbox and media queries were employed to ensure the design is intuitive and user-friendly, while the favicon and visual assets were created to align with the podcast’s unique brand identity.
